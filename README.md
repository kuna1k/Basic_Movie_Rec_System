# Basic_Movie_Rec_System
This Python script creates a movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user input. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to transform movie attributes like genres, keywords, and cast into feature vectors, and then calculates cosine similarity to identify and rank movies that are most similar to the user's chosen title.
